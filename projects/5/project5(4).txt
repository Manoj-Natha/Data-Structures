Submit:    eLearning

Late Policy:  -10 points per hour late

Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objective:

     Write and compare different sorting algorithms.


Overview:

     Write a bucket sort routine and compare it to a quick sort and insertion sort.


Details:

     The book provides a Sort class that contains methods for various sorting algorithms.

     Add a new method to this class for a bucket sort.  This method should be written by you based on your understanding of the algorithm.  You should not use one found on the Internet.

     Change the main method to generate a report showing runs of various sizes and the resulting running times for each of these:  bucket sort, quick sort, insertion sort.

     After running your program, create a line graph (in Excel or other) that plots the running times.  Include in the graph the lines for N, N Log N, N*N, for comparison, or make a separate graph showing these three functions.
