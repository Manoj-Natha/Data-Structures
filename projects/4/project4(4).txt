Due Dates:  Saturday, October 31 at 11:59pm 

Submit:    eLearning

Late Policy:  -10 points per hour late

Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objectives:

     Create a hash table.
     Use the hash table to improve a poor-performing program.


Description:

     Attached is a program file named DupLL.java.  Its purpose is to read
     a file of phone numbers and report duplicates.  Its main method opens a 
     file of 5003 phone numbers (ph.txt) in which one number has one duplicate
     and another number has two duplicates.

     It uses a LinkedList with a very poor-performing algorithm to find the duplicates.
     Due to the nested loops, the same duplicate will be reported more than once.

     You need to convert this program to use a hash table and improve the
     algorithm for finding the duplicates, reporting each duplicate once.  

     The hash table should be your own creation, not copied from the textbook 
     or other sources. You should think through each required method and design 
     and code it yourself.

     The design of the hash table is up to you, as long as it is a hash table
     that you created.


Questions:

     Submit answers to these questions in addition to your source code:

     1) Explain the algorithm in the original program, including
        why duplicates are reported more than once.

     2) What is the Big-O running time of the original program?  
        Explain your answer.

     3) Explain the algorithm in your new program.

     4) What is the Big-O running time of the new program?
        Explain your answer.

     5) How long does the original program take to complete?
        How long does the new program take to complete?


Scoring:
     Hash table:  50 points
     Program with revised algorithm:  40 points
     Questions:   10 points
