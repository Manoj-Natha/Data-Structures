Questions are 10 points each.



1) Show the result of inserting the following values one at a time into 
   an initially empty binary heap. (Show the heap after each insert).
   Use trees to illustrate each heap.

     
     42, 11, 28, 8, 13, 61, 18



2) Show how the final heap created in the previous problem would be stored
   in an array.  


3) Show the result after a deleteMin on this binary heap.  (Show each step).
